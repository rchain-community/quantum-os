#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run-node.sh — a standalone RChain node to develop /rholang against.
#
#   bash run-node.sh          start (reuses existing chain state)
#   bash run-node.sh --fresh  wipe the data dir and rebuild genesis first
#
# The node binary is bin/rnode, committed at the repo root, so a checkout of
# quantum-os alone is enough to bring a chain up -- no rchain-rust checkout, no
# PATH symlink. Set RNODE=/path/to/rnode to run a different build against the
# same genesis, which is how a candidate rnode gets tested before it replaces
# bin/rnode.
#
# The flags are not decoration; each one earns its place:
#
#   --host 127.0.0.1     without it the node guesses an external IP and Kademlia
#                        fails to bind.
#   --api-host 127.0.0.1 the HTTP API the browser talks to. Without it /rholang
#                        cannot reach the node at all.
#   --dev-mode           lets `/rholang eval` work. Exploratory deploy is refused
#                        on a validating node unless dev mode is on. It does not
#                        affect block production — measured, both ways.
#
# NOT set: --min-phlo-price 0. At price 0 the charge is zero and pre_charge
# returns before it looks at any balance, which makes it look like a shortcut. It
# is not: block production then fails outright, every propose ending in
# "Validation of self created block failed with reason: InvalidStateHash".
# Measured on a fresh genesis, one flag apart — plain flags produce blocks,
# adding --min-phlo-price 0 produces none.
#
# wallet.txt funds the keys in pk.txt, and genesis seeds those balances into the
# node's native vault state, so a deploy from either key is pre-charged and
# executes. Both `/rholang eval` and `/rholang deploy` reach the qucalc
# powerbox — verified against rchain-rust dev f3f4759e9.
