// Role registry for the generalized room-agent daemon (`agent.mjs`).
//
// An agent is a full room member with an identity, a measured-disruption budget,
// and an optional AI advisor. Its *role* selects a default name, a command prefix,
// an AI persona, and which proactive duties it performs. The facilitator is just
// one role; `scribe` and `greeter` show the generality (and compose: run several
// agents in one room and they de-conflict shared duties — see agent.mjs).
//
// Duties (each gated per-role; "lead-only" ones run only for the elected lead agent
// when multiple agents share the duty, so N agents don't all greet at once):
//   intro          one-time room hello on first peer            (lead-only)
//   greet          welcome each newcomer once                   (lead-only)
//   namePrompt     nudge the nameless to set a /name            (lead-only)
//   silentQuarter  invite a long-silent member to weigh in      (lead-only)
//   dominator      gently rebalance one voice taking the room   (lead-only)
//   discrepancy    surface (dis)agreement from consensus probes
//   stimulate      AI: re-engage after a lull                   (lead-only)
//   synthesize     AI: name the crux of a disagreement
// `ask` (the `/<cmd> ask` AI answer) is always available when --ai is on.
