// faucet-http.mjs — the test-REV faucet as an HTTP endpoint, for a wallet.
//
// The room's `/<role> faucet <address>` is a chat command over the mesh —
// fine for a person in the room, useless to a wallet that only speaks HTTP.
// This is the same faucet with an HTTP face: `POST /faucet {"address"}` (or
// `GET /faucet?address=`) → the agent's `send(address)`, which deploys the
// same `$transfer` from the same throwaway key.
//
// WIRE-COMPATIBLE WITH RNODE'S OWN FAUCET. rchain-rust's dev-mode node has a
// native `POST /api/faucet {"address"}` → `{deployId, amount, to}` (amount in
// dust), and r-wallet already calls exactly that. This endpoint answers in
// that shape (plus its own fields) and is served at `/api/faucet` as well as
// `/faucet`, so a reverse proxy can route `/api/faucet` here and a wallet
// needs no change — it just sees a faucet that also rate-limits. What the room command
// deliberately lacks — a rate limit — this one must have: the room command is
// reachable only by whoever holds the room cap, an HTTP port by anyone on the
// internet, and an unlimited faucet on a public port is a drained faucet.
//
//   per address  one grant per `addrCooldownMs` (default 24 h)
//   per client   `ipPerHour` grants per hour (default 5), keyed on the first
//                X-Forwarded-For hop when present (the port is meant to sit
//                behind a TLS proxy), else the socket address
//
// Limits are in memory — a restart forgets them, which on a test system is
// the right failure. No key, no chain knowledge here: `send` is injected, so
// faucet-http.selftest.mjs exercises every path with a stub.
//
