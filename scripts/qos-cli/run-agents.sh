# Launch QuantumOS room agents DETACHED, on your Claude subscription (claude-code
# backend — needs the `claude` CLI installed + logged in). Because they're nohup'd,
# they keep running after you close the terminal (use tmux/screen or a service for
# survival across logout/reboot).
#
#   bash run-agents.sh [room-cap-or-url] [role ...]
#
# Defaults: the public room + facilitator. Stable identity per role under
# ./.qos-<role>; logs + pids under ./.agents. Stop with ./stop-agents.sh.
#
# HOW MANY AGENTS
#
# The default is ONE: the facilitator, carrying the room's memory via --persist.
# Two co-located node agents burn CPU on the werift ICE between each other —
# measured at ~35%/core for the facilitator<->skeptic connection alone, dropping
# to ~5% the moment the second agent stops (werift's ICE layer, no consent
# timer; the #125 fingerprint memo does not cover the whole SDP-rebuild path).
# The facilitator's duties are a superset of scribe's and greeter's, so neither
# is worth a peer. `skeptic` is the only role with `verify` (which predicate a
# history actually passed) — add it explicitly when you need that and accept the
# CPU cost:  bash run-agents.sh "$ROOM" facilitator skeptic
#
# The `/rholang` macro agent is NOT started here — the browser expands locally,
# so the agent is only worth a peer when you want the expansion posted into chat
# for the room to read. Start it by hand if you do:
#   node rholang-agent.mjs --room <cap> --name rholang
