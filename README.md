# quantum-os

> **QuantumOS (QOS) is an intelligent gateway to each other and everything.** It is the rho ZFA peer-to-peer layer — proven secure. Every identity, message, claim, and unit of value is a capability token whose validity is a machine-checked algebraic fact (Curry–Howard security, Lean-verified in [QLF](https://github.com/rchain-community/quantum-logical-framework)), not a policy anyone has to trust or a server anyone has to ask. To an engineer that reads as *zero-trust p2p with capability tokens standing in for ACLs, sessions, and TLS all at once*. To anyone else it reads more simply: reaching another person and reaching the truth, the agreement, or the value between you are the same one verified act — the gateway to each other *is* the gateway to everything, because in QOS a relationship and a reality are the same kind of object.
>
> That security model runs **off-chain by default** — rooms, capability tokens, lemmas, notes, polls, rendezvous swaps, governance, and the file library are all verified peer-to-peer by the algebra itself, no consensus and no ledger required. That's not a limitation, it's the point: everyday activity leaves no public trace to correlate and costs nothing beyond the peers' own bandwidth. A blockchain (`/rholang`, the pooled token exchange, wrapped native tokens) is an opt-in extension reached for deliberately — a durable public record, a currency that must exist outside any one room — never a dependency of the security or privacy guarantee.
>
> It is also **quantum-secure where it counts**: capability tokens, dyncap identity, and the identity vault are built from CSPRNG entropy, SHA-256, and AES-256-GCM — no factoring or discrete-log keypair for Shor's algorithm to break, only the same brute-force search a quantum computer only quadratically speeds up (Grover). Only the opt-in chain path (`/rholang deploy`, secp256k1) carries the classical exposure every blockchain has today — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#quantum-security).

**Create reality together.** Two or more peers in a room share a ZFA process space — a combined `parallel(peer1, peer2, …)` that is provably ZFA-balanced by construction. The room is not a chat channel; it is a shared physical process where every identity is a capability token and every interaction is a verified quantum logical event.

Peer-to-peer QuantumOS running in the browser. ZFA kernel in Rust/WASM, WebRTC data channels for transport, self-hosted signaling server.

### How to create reality together

1. Open **https://rchain-community.github.io/quantum-os/** in your browser.
2. Click **Connect** — you join a room identified by a ZFA capability token in the URL hash. Your peer ID is a ZFA-balanced process.
3. Copy the share link and send it to someone (or open a second tab).
4. The second peer clicks **Connect** — both appear in the **Peers** list.
5. The **Room Process** panel shows the combined `parallel(you, peer)` process — ZFA-balanced across all peers.
6. Run QLF slash commands (`/braket +`, `/qucalc ^v`) — output broadcasts to every peer in the room.
7. Click a peer's name to instantly evaluate their ZFA process with `/qucalc`.
8. Use `/lemma` to name a logical claim — write it as a sentence and mark the handle with `@` (`/lemma All men are @mortal`); twists auto-allocate from the handle, or supply them after a pipe (`/lemma All men are @mortal | ^v`). Reference with `@mortal` in any command (`/qucalc @mortal @socrates` deduces from both). Lemmas sync to all peers and persist across page reloads.
9. Use `/grant [label]` to mint a random ZFA capability token and share it as a proof object.
10. Use `/request name` to signal you need a named lemma; the holder sees a prompt and can `/pass name peer` to transfer it directly — no token strings to copy.

Beyond evaluation, a room is a full collaboration space: take **group decisions** (`/poll`, `/estimate`, the `/probe` consensus check, trust-weighted `/gov` liquid democracy); invite **AI agent members** — a trust-governed *facilitator*, *scribe*, and *skeptic* that join as full peers and run on a Claude subscription ([Developer Guide](Developer_Guide.md)); and run the room as a **quantum problem solver** (below). New here? Start with the **[User Guide](User_Guide.md)**.

The room URL encodes a ZFA capability token in the hash (`#room=cap:room:…`). Anyone with the link can join — no account needed. The public signaling server (`wss://quantum-os-signaling.onrender.com`) is used by default; edit the field to point at a self-hosted server.

### The room as a quantum problem solver

**A QuantumOS room optimizes the way a quantum annealer actually does — by relaxing toward a low-energy consensus, not by "trying every answer at once."** Many minds (human *and* AI) propose candidates in parallel; the room scores them cheaply and **trust-weighted**; a facilitator lowers the "temperature" each round — explore wide early, refine the leader late — until the room settles on a ZFA-balanced closure and records it with `/lemma` + `/persist`. That is a physically faithful metaheuristic: the [Quantum Logical Framework](https://github.com/rchain-community/quantum-logical-framework) says the substrate itself selects by closure / least free action (`ΔF = −log 2` per event), and the room realizes that same selection principle at the *logical* layer where human-meaningful problems live.

- **`/facil optimize <objective + constraints>`** — an AI facilitator runs a round: proposes candidates, suggests the scoring step (`/estimate` or `/poll`), and on the next call refines the leaders (the *anneal*) toward `/probe` → `/lemma`.
- **`/search [position]`** — the possibility step made literal, and **the search is the experiment**: the browser enumerates the admissible **next closures** from the room's current QuCalc position — the a-priori possibility space the room is annealing over — and asks the substrate which of them close from *here* (truth divination; truth is what closes). A port of the [QLF reference](https://github.com/rchain-community/quantum-logical-framework/blob/main/QucalcSearch.md), run locally — no service. Bare `/search` runs one enumeration over every peer's position with shared listeners — a **meeting of minds**, the room reading its own possibility space.
- **`/solve [position]`** — the selection step: **`/search` renders every way to close; `/solve` finds the solution, or the path to it.** It picks the one closure the substrate takes by a deterministic least-free-action cascade (so every peer agrees), widening the horizon until something closes; on a miss it reports the residual — what a completion still owes.
- **Why a room, not a QPU:** runs in a browser with nothing to cool; takes the problem in plain language (no lossy QUBO/Ising encoding); handles soft, qualitative, evolving objectives an energy function can't express; and every step is explainable and dyncap-auditable — a trust-weighted decision trail, not a black-box bitstring.

**Honest scope:** like every metaheuristic — and like a real annealer — it finds *good* solutions, not provably optimal ones; it is not an NP solver. Full method, worked example, and the QLF grounding: **[Collective Optimization →](Collective_Optimization.md)** · runnable demo (a room session converging to the brute-force TSP optimum): **[OptimizationDemo.md →](OptimizationDemo.md)** (`node scripts/qos-cli/optimize-demo.mjs`).

**Foundation:** [Quantum Logical Framework](https://github.com/rchain-community/quantum-logical-framework) — ZFA (Zero Free Action) is the security model. Every peer identity is a ZFA-balanced capability token. Possessing a token IS authorization (Curry-Howard for capabilities). The room process `parallel(peer1, peer2, …)` is machine-verified to stay ZFA-balanced under composition — decoherence is impossible by construction.

| Layer | Runs in CI | Command |
|---|---|---|
| Rust kernel | ✓ | `pnpm test:rust` |
| Browser TypeScript | ✓ | `pnpm --filter @quantum-os/browser typecheck`; `node packages/browser/test/<name>.test.mjs` |
| Plain-JS modules (`--selftest`) | ✓ | `node packages/browser/src/macro-lang.js --selftest` (and `locker.js`, `rholang-exchange.js`, `wrapped-token.js`, `scripts/qos-cli/rholang-macros.mjs`) |
| Headless peer (`scripts/qos-cli`) | ✗ — outside the workspace | the `*.selftest.mjs` / `*.e2e.mjs` list in [scripts/qos-cli/README.md](scripts/qos-cli/README.md#verify-offline-no-network-no-deps) |

---

## Architecture

```
crates/zfa-core/        Rust — the ZFA kernel → WASM (browser) and native
packages/signaling/     TypeScript — WebSocket signaling relay (never sees data-channel contents)
packages/browser/       TypeScript — the WebRTC peer + the app; loads the WASM kernel
scripts/qos-cli/        Node — headless peer, memory daemon, agents, bridge (outside the workspace)
scripts/localnet/       a local rnode to develop `/rholang` against
```

Cargo workspace + pnpm workspace. **The full engineering parent — layout, the security model
as the code enforces it, the browser peer API, the Rust kernel, the signaling wire protocol,
the WASM exports — is [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).**

**Security in one paragraph.** Every identity, room, claim and unit of value is a ZFA
capability token: a twist history that is both count-balanced and Pauli-closed, minted by
rejection sampling so an unbalanced token cannot be issued
([`crates/zfa-core/src/capability.rs`](crates/zfa-core/src/capability.rs)). Possessing the
token *is* the authorization; there is no account and no server-side state. The proof that
count balance implies Pauli closure is
[`count_balanced_pauli_closed`](https://github.com/rchain-community/quantum-logical-framework/blob/main/lean/QLF_TwistAlphabet.lean);
the threat model, known issues and reporting policy are [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

---

## Headless peer, memory, agents (`scripts/qos-cli`)

A Node peer that speaks the browser's exact wire protocol: **one-shot announce**
(`qos-cli.mjs`), a **memory daemon** that persists and re-serves a room's public state so
knowledge survives every browser leaving (`qos-daemon.mjs`), **AI agent members** —
facilitator, scribe, skeptic, greeter, observer (`agent.mjs`, [Developer Guide](Developer_Guide.md)) —
and a **bridge** that stands in two rooms at once ([Room_Bridges.md](Room_Bridges.md)).

```bash
cd scripts/qos-cli && npm install
node qos-cli.mjs --room "<cap:room:… | room-URL>" --message "hello room"
bash run-agents.sh "" facilitator observer      # defaults to the MyRoom test room
```

Rooms are peer-to-peer: a message reaches only the peers present at that moment; the daemon
is the room's persistence layer, not a server. Full docs: **[scripts/qos-cli/README.md](scripts/qos-cli/README.md)**.
