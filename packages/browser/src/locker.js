// locker.js — the private hierarchical dictionary, keyed by deployerId.
//
// A `$name` bound to a capability lives in a room today, which means it does not
// outlive the room. The locker is where one survives: your names, your identity
// record, and the credentials other people issued you.
//
// Everything here is reached by capability. The locker sits at a registry uri,
// and every verb takes a `deployerId`, which rnode issues only to the deploy
// that signed for it. Publishing the locker's uri therefore grants nothing:
// holding it still reaches only your own entry. No quoted names — see
// SECURITY.md.
//
// The id IS the authority. There is no equality check anywhere in the contract,
// because there is nothing to check: an entry can only be written under the id
// the caller passed, and the only id a caller can produce is their own.
//
// What restricts the SUBJECT is the shape of each verb, not a permission bit:
//
//   setSelf  reaches "self" and nothing else — never "rev", never "creds"
//   addCred  appends to "creds"; a credential carries the issuer who signed it,
//            so a reader weighs it by who that is rather than by who stored it
//   (nobody) can alter "rev", which register fixed
//
// That is why the write capability register hands back is restricted. A subject
// who could write their own credentials would make credentials worth nothing.
//
// Plain JS with no imports so both the browser and a room agent consume it
// directly, and so its tests run under node with no build:
//
//   node packages/browser/src/locker.js --selftest

/**
 * The locker contract. Deployed once; its uri is then the address everyone uses.
 *
 * Verified against rnode (rchain-rust `dev` at 0a2141be1) by exploratory deploy:
 * register is idempotent and reports `already`, setSelf and addCred land in the
 * right compartments, bind/resolve are isolated per identity (resolving another
 * identity's name returns Nil), and a granted facet writes exactly one key.
 *
 * Re-verified 2026-09-23 against rnodeapi.rhobot.net with signed deploys, by
 * `scripts/localnet/locker-check.mjs` — install, register, register again,
 * bind, resolve, bob resolving alice's name (empty), read, grant, and an
 * unknown verb: 9 of 9. That run exists because two things here were broken
 * and neither showed up in a test that never left the browser:
 *
 *   - the call unwrapped a `(_, caps)` tuple from `rho:registry:lookup`, which
 *     is the Scala shape. This node answers the BARE value, so every call fell
 *     to the default branch and reported `["no locker at", uri]` for a locker
 *     that was present and healthy.
 *   - the answer went only to `return`, which the deploy wrapper forwards to
 *     the key's registry result slot — and that slot is not written on every
 *     node. Every verb now answers on `rho:rchain:deployId` as well.
 *
 * Both were found while building `rgov-core.js`, which hit the same two.
 *
 * Two shape rules, and the first one is not a preference:
 *
 *   1. Every contract takes at least two parameters. A one-binder persistent
 *      receive inside a nested `new` does not terminate — it re-fires until the
 *      reduction budget stops it (rchain-rust#19). These contracts live in a
 *      `new` that the deploy wrapper nests inside another, so the shape applies
 *      here. Nothing needs a one-parameter verb, so nothing is written as one.
 *   2. Readers CONSUME AND RESTORE (`for (@r <- cell) { cell!(r) | … }`). Peek
 *      (`<<-`) would also work; consuming serialises the readers of a cell,
 *      which is the behaviour worth having when several verbs mutate the same
 *      map.
