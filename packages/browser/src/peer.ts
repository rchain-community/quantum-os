 * STUN alone — this file's own fallback when nobody hands it `iceServers`.

 * a mobile carrier doing CGNAT, a NAT'd container — have no address pair that
 * works, so the handshake fails permanently and retrying cannot help. That
 * case needs a TURN relay, and **chat surviving over the flood overlay used to
 * hide this**: a data-channel message can flood peer-to-agent-to-peer with no
 * direct link, but a `MediaStreamTrack` cannot, so a call between two networks
 * produced no video at all, silently (quantum-os#126).
 *
 * `peer.ts` itself still defaults to STUN-only — this constant is what a bare
 * `new QOSPeer(...)` gets (tests, `qospeer.mjs`, anyone who doesn't ask for
 * more). The **app** (`app.ts` `fetchAutoTurn`) is what supplies a relay by
 * default for a real room: it fetches a short-lived, Cloudflare-minted TURN
 * credential from the signaling server's own `GET /turn` (the master API
 * token never leaves that server) and merges it into `iceServers` before
 * `connect()`. "Whose machine your media passes through is a decision" still
 * holds — `/ice auto off` opts out, `/ice turn ...` substitutes your own.

   *
   * Closing a working connection because ring math shifted turned out to have
   * a real cost: a roster change reshuffles ring positions for *everyone*,
   * so one flaky peer bouncing in and out of the room could cascade into
   * closing OTHER peers' entirely healthy connections as a side effect —
   * amplifying one device's instability into churn across the room, observed
   * live during testing. The grace period (PRUNE_GRACE_MS) bounded how often
   * that could happen, not whether it could.
   *
   * So: targetPeers() / ringSkipNeighbors still bound who gets *newly*
   * dialled (the actual fix for the join-burst / signaling rate-limit
   * problem this overlay exists for), but an already-open connection is now
   * never actively closed just because it fell outside the ring. Degree
   * can only grow past 4 over a long session with a lot of churn passing
   * through, never shrink back — an accepted tradeoff for never being the
   * cause of a working connection dropping. prunePeer/clearPruneTimer stay
   * in place (and covered by tests) so this can be re-enabled deliberately,
   * behind something better than a fixed per-peer grace timer — e.g. only
   * pruning once the *room*, not just one peer, has been stable for a while.
